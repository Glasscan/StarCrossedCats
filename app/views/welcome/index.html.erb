  Project Star Grazed is designed to be an app where people interested in learning about stars and constellations
  can get a quick look using our easy to use sky-map. Star Grazed will utilize Star-API, a free RESTful API, that
  provides access to the American Museum of Natural Historyâ€™s Digital Universe Data.  Star-API provides access to
  positions of stars and constellations which will enable the user to experience an accurate representation of the
  universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  This app is fully intended to be an interactive learning tool as there are no reliable or easily accessible
  systems outside of a classroom setting. Please sign up and log-in to play and learn more about stars and
  constellations.
